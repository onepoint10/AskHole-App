# ✅ Workflow Features - Ready to Use!

## 🎉 Integration Complete

The Workflow Spaces feature is now **fully integrated** and **ready to use**!

## 🚀 How to Access

### 1. Start the Application

The frontend is already running on **http://localhost:5174**

If you need to start the backend:
```bash
cd /Users/onepoint/ReactProjects/AskHole-App/backend
source ../.venv/bin/activate
python src/main.py
```

### 2. Find the Workflows Button

Look in the **sidebar header** (top section):
- You'll see a purple **folder icon** (📁) 
- It's next to the help icon (?)
- Located before the admin shield icon (🛡️)

### 3. Click It!

Clicking the Workflows button will:
- Open a full-screen Workflow Spaces view
- Show all your workspaces (empty at first)
- Provide a "New Workspace" button
- Show a "Back to Chat" button in the header

## 📍 Visual Guide

```
Sidebar Layout:
┌──────────────────────────┐
│ [⚙️] [?] [📁] [🛡️]      │  ← Look here!
│           ↑              │
│           │              │
│    Workflows Button      │
│    (Purple folder icon)  │
└──────────────────────────┘
```

## 🎯 What You Can Do

### In Workflow Spaces:

1. **Create Workspaces**
   - Click "+ New Workspace"
   - Name it, add description
   - Make it public or private

2. **Manage Workspaces**
   - View all your projects
   - See stats (prompts, members, workflows)
   - Edit or delete workspaces

3. **Build Workflows**
   - Click on a workspace
   - Add prompts to it
   - Create workflow graphs
   - Execute workflows (creates record)

4. **Version Control**
   - View prompt version history
   - Create version snapshots
   - Restore previous versions

5. **Team Collaboration**
   - Add team members
   - Assign roles (owner, editor, viewer)
   - Manage permissions

## 🧪 Quick Test

1. Open http://localhost:5174 in your browser
2. Log in if needed
3. Look at the sidebar header
4. Click the purple folder icon (📁)
5. See "Workflow Spaces" full screen
6. Click "+ New Workspace"
7. Create a test workspace
8. Explore the features!

## ✨ What's Working

- ✅ UI integration complete
- ✅ Button visible in sidebar
- ✅ Full-screen workspace view
- ✅ Create/edit/delete workspaces
- ✅ Add prompts to workspaces
- ✅ Build workflow graphs
- ✅ View execution history
- ✅ Version control for prompts
- ✅ Team member management
- ✅ Public/private workspaces

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. **Workflow Execution**: The "Execute" button creates an execution record but doesn't actually run the workflow logic yet.

2. **Basic Visualization**: The workflow editor shows a simple list view, not a drag-and-drop graph editor.

3. **No Real-time Updates**: Changes don't sync in real-time for other users.

4. **Database Versioning Only**: Uses database instead of actual Git (GitPython integration would be needed for full Git features).

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Don't see the button?**
- Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify frontend is running on port 5174

**Button doesn't work?**
- Check browser console for errors
- Make sure backend is running on port 5000
- Verify you're logged in

**Components don't load?**
- Check network tab for failed API calls
- Ensure database tables exist (they auto-create)
- Check backend console for errors
